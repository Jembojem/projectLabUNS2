## What is Nge-Lab?

Nge-lab is a website that is useful for borrowing or ordering laboratories at Sebelas Maret State University. The laboratories that can later be ordered are the computer laboratory, the network laboratory, the robotics laboratory, and the multimedia laboratory. The website will consist of 3 actors, namely guest, member, and admin. The appearance on the website is seen by the three actors, but for the panel view it will only be accessed by the admin. In each laboratory there are several facilities that can be used and ordered by members only. Guests who have registered on the system will be registered as members on this website.
